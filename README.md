# Overview

Thirtydollarnoteblocks is a browser extension for thirtydollar.website
that changes the notes to be Minecraft sounds.


# How to Install

0. Use Firefox (the extension currently does not work on Chrome. That functionality is still a work in progress!).
1. Download a ZIP of the extension by clicking on the green box labelled `Code` near the top right corner of the page.
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. In Firefox, type `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` into the address bar.
4. Under the `Temporary Extensions` menu, click on the button labelled `Load Temporary Add-on...` You may need to open the menu to be able to see the button.
5. Go to where you saved your extracted ZIP file, and select the file called `manifest.json`
6. The extension is now loaded until the browser is closed! Go to thirtydollar.website to begin making some jams!

A more permanent solution is currently being worked on.

Feel free to open issues and create pull requests! This is my first time making any sort of
browser extension, so I am clueless about a lot of things. Thank you for your help ^w^
